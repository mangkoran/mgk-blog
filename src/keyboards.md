# Keyboards

I began my journey in mechanical keyboard rabbit hole when I discovered
[r/MK](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards). From there I found
inspiration to build a hand-wired numpad, solely for playing
[osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) (as I broke some of my laptop keys).

My preference for now: ortholinear, silent tactile.

## Collections

Below is a humble list of my keyboards:

- Hand-wired 4x3 numpad, built with Gateron Brown (it's linear I told you)
- Anne Pro 2, built with Kailh Box Jade (deafening clicky)
- [ai03's contra](https://github.com/ai03-2725/contra), built with Akko Matcha
  Green (linear)
- [Steven Karrmann's morizon](https://github.com/skarrmann/morizon), built with
  Gaote Cream Yellow (silent tactile)
