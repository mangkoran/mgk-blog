# About me

Hi, Mangkoran's here! I'm a software engineer primarily interested in Kubernetes, cloud computing
and automation. Currently I'm a site reliability engineer at [AccelByte](https://accelbyte.io/),
working on various internal team projects.

# Interests

During my free time, I do enjoy several things:

- Build mechanical keyboards
- Listening to music with my in-ear monitors
- Watch esports
- Play games
- Read books (including visual novels)
