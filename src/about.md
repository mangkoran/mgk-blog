# About

Hi, Mangkoran's here! I'm a computer nerd primarily interested in Kubernetes, cloud computing,
system automation and networking. Currently I'm a site reliability engineer at
[AccelByte](https://accelbyte.io/).

# Interests

During my free time, I do enjoy several things:

- Build mechanical keyboards
- Listening to music with my in-ear monitors
- Watch esports
- Play games
- Read books (including visual novels)
