# About

Hi, Mangkoran's here! I'm a computer nerd primarily interested in Kubernetes,
cloud computing, system automation and networking. Currently I'm a site
reliability engineer at [AccelByte](https://accelbyte.io/).

## Interests

During my free time, I do enjoy doing several things:

- Build mechanical keyboards
- Watch esports (League, CS)
- Read books (including visual novels)
