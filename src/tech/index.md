# Interests

Since junior high I have been curious with Linux. Back then I joined local IT community and learned
Linux Mint with Mas Ibnu (if I remembered his name correctly). Fast forward, I dug deeper and deeper
and now I use Linux on my systems: WSL on my main system (it's a Linux!) and Arch on my second
system.
